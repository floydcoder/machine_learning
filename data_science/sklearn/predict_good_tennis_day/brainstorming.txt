What are the variables that can effect a good-day or a bad-day for playing tennis?
- Based on my understanding:
  Weather:
    * Rain
      - Light rain: < 2.5 mm per hour
      - Moderate rain: between 2.5 mm and 7.6 per hour
      - Heavy rain: > 7.6 per hour OR between 7.6 mm and 10 mm per hour
      - Violent rain: > 50 mm per hour
    * Wind
      - Calm: < 2 Km/h
      - Light air: between 2 and 6 km/h
      - Light Breeze: between 7 and 11 km/h
      - Gentle Breeze: between 13  and 19 km/h
      - Moderate Breeze: between 20  and 30 km/h
      - Fresh Breeze: between 31  and 39 km/h
      - Strong Breeze: between 41  and 50 km/h
      - Moderate Gale: between 51  and 61 km/h
      - Fresh Gale: between 61  and 74 km/h
      - Strong Gale: between 74  and 87 km/h
      - Whole Gale:  between 87  and 102 km/h
      - Storm: between 102 and 117 km/h
      - Hurricane: > 117 km/h
    * UV
      - Minimal risk: 0 to 2
      - Low risk: 3 to 5, but hat, sunscreen and glasses are recommended  
      - Moderate Risk: 6 to 7, should be careful and be protected by sunscreen to sensitives areas
      - High Risk: 8 to 10, minimize sun exposure from 10 am to 4pm. When outside seek shade
      - Very High Risk: > 11, People working outside can be in danger. Minimize sun exposure 
    * Air Quality 
      - Good(1-3): 0 to 50
      - Moderate(4-6): 51 to 200
      - Very Unhealthy(7-9): 201 to 300
      - Hazardous(10-11): 301 to 500 
    * Humidity
      - comfortable: 20 to 29
      - some discomfort: 30 to 39
      - great discomfort: 40 to 45
      - dangerous: > 45 
    * Temperatures 
      - Glacial: < - 13
      - Freezing: between -12 to -6  
      - Very Cold: between -5 and 0
      - Quite Cold: between 1 to 5
      - Cold: between 6 to 10
      - Chilly: between 11 13
      - Not cold: between 14 to 17
      - slightly Warm: between 18 to 20
      - Warm: between 21 to 25
      - Quite warm: 26 to 28
      - Hot: 29 to 33
      - Very hot: 34 to 38
      - Too Hot: 39 to 42
      - Extreme Heat: 42 to 46
      - Unbearably Heating: > 46
    * Visibility
      - Light Fog: 500 m 
      - Moderate Fog: Between 500 and 200 meters
      - Thick Fog: Between 200 and 50 meters
      - Dense Fog: < 50 meters 
    * Snow
      -Low: < 0.5 inches per hour
      -Medium: between 0.5 inches and 1.5 inches per hour
      -High: > 1.5 inches per hour
- Based on internet research 
  - Type of the court -> Grass, Clay, Hard or Astro-Turf
    * Astro-Turf: Playable when rain stops, if heavy downpour the court takes 1/2 hour to drain.
    * Hard: A bit harder to play on them when wet, but they drain pretty fast.
    * Clay: Tends to soak up the water, but if it is extremely heavy rain the court can be damaged.
    * Grass: extremely slippery when wet, even the pros would restrain from playing.
    

It is important to consider that depending on the weather, different types of tennis courts can be effected
differently.

Rules of coexistence:

Never UV > 0 

                    -> Rain: POSSIBLE 
Temperatures > 0 =  
                    -> Snow: IMPOSSIBLE


                    -> Rain: IMPOSSIBLE 
Temperatures < -1 =                      = The higher is the humidly 
                                           the greater the snow fall  
                    -> Snow: POSSIBLE
