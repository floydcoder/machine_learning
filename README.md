# Machine Learning

This repository showcases a variety of projects that explore the fascinating world of Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Key Aspects of this Repo:

* #### Working with Numpy

Numpy is a fundamental library in Python for scientific computing, particularly in the field of data analysis. Here, you can find examples of how to work with arrays, perform mathematical operations, and manipulate data using this powerful library.

* #### Working with Pandas

Pandas is a widely used library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. This section includes examples of how to read, filter, and analyze data using Pandas.

* #### Predicting Crime Rates Across US

In this project, we use Machine Learning algorithms to predict crime rates across the United States. We explore different models, such as linear regression and decision trees, and compare their performance to determine which is the most accurate.

* #### Predicting COVID-19 Based on Symptoms

Using Machine Learning algorithms, we can predict whether someone has contracted COVID-19 based on their symptoms. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation.

* #### Predicting a Good Tennis Match Based on the Weather

In this project, we use Machine Learning to predict the outcome of a tennis match based on the weather conditions on the day of the match. We explore different models, such as logistic regression and random forests, and compare their performance to determine which is the most accurate.

* #### Intro to Neural Networks - Overfitting and Accuracy

This section covers the fundamentals of Neural Networks, including overfitting and accuracy. We explore different methods to prevent overfitting, such as regularization and early stopping.

* #### Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks are widely used in Computer Vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. In this project, we explore the fundamentals of CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions.

* #### A Neural Network Model that Predicts Client Turnover

In this project, we use a Neural Network to predict whether a client will leave a company or not. We explore different models and feature engineering techniques to determine which approach is the most accurate.
